Backstory:
Long ago, Earth went dark on the same day all existing electronics in the solar system stopped working. All ships not in orbit fell from the sky.
Humanity quickly descended into chaos as society collapsed, bringing on a new Dark Age. Most of the population succumbed to famine as governments broke down and nations fractured.
Around 1000 years later the Western Pacific is recovering and has entered a new Medieval Era, largely forgetting the accurate history of humanity and the disaster. 
Knowledge of the off-world colonies has faded into myths and legends, until one day a derelict ship, carrying a strange elongated race that cannot survive in the gravity well of Earth, arrived in orbit.

The Colormap used in this mod is from Bonelorde's April fool's joke that I am unable to find the link for at the moment.
