#BM_MIDDLE_MARS_ERA_INFO;This can currently only be used with the Random World setting which requires the Holy Fury DLC, or with the provided save file. Trying to launch the mod without using the Random World setting or save file will crash the game.\nReligion, culture, and de jure locations have been manually set, so it is ironically recommended to use all historical settings possible within Random World. Random world is a work-around until events can be made compatible.\n\nRecommended settings for Random World:\nAll settings set to Historical, except culture names set to random\nDefault title names\nAll boxes checked except 'More Pagans';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_MIDDLE_MARS_ERA_INFO;Long ago, many centuries after Mars had been fully Terraformed, Earth went dark on the same day all existing electronics on Mars stopped working. All ships not in orbit fell from the sky.\n\nMars quickly descended into chaos as society collapsed, bringing on a new Dark Age. Most of the population succumbed to famine as governments broke down and nations fractured.\n\nAround 1000 years later humanity is recovering and has entered a new Medieval Era, largely forgetting the accurate history of humanity and the disaster. No one except the Spacers know if Earth is still around and is thought of as more of a holy icon and legend. Some ideologies reject the concept or existence of Earth as we know it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_102265;Maximilianos of Olympus Mons;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_102265;The Hellenic Kingdom of Mount Olympus is on it's way to unification, but sees nations of similar size creeping in from fellow Hellenics in Gigas Sulci, Singularists in Olympica Fossae, Zunists in Tharsis Montes, and the Divine Cycle on the Daedalian Planum.\n\nBeyond Tharsis Mons and the Daedalian Planum are Altered agents plotting entry into the western regions, and nomads squabiling among themselves, though who could potentially became an unstopable threat if they were ever managed to be united.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_111585;Abdul-Aziz of Noachis Terra;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_111585;Westen Argyre, a longtime staple of the Blessed Singularity Valles Marineris Empire, has been conquered by the almightly Terraformed who sailed across the Argyrian Sea from Noachis Terra.\nNow controlling nearly the entire Argyrian Sea, Abdul-Aziz sets his sights north toward Valles Marineris to finish off the troublesome Empire once and for all.\n\nTo the west of West Argyre are scattered pagan tribals, and an Animist kingdom deep within Solis Planum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_104895;Oceania of Valles Marineris;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_104895;Westen Argyre, a longtime staple of the Blessed Singularity Valles Marineris Empire, has been conquered by the treacherous Terraformed who sailed across the Argyrian Sea from Noachis Terra.\nThe Empire stands in shambles, having also ceded their western and north-eastern territories in an independence revolt that resulted in the destruction of many settlements across the once illustrious Valles. \nThe western traitors, calling themselves the Empire of Noctis Fossae, seek to unite the disorganized lands between themselves and the Kingdoms of Alba to become the uncontested regional power to replace Valles Marineris.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_100785;Roy of South Alba;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_100785;Holy Terra, the remnants of modern day Catholics, prepare for the first crusade since before the disaster. The Kingdom of South Alba seems well poised to benefit from this crusade, however, is in a constant state of flux with their Orthodox neighbor, the King of North Alba. Both kingdoms remain unstable due to the rulers not being the same culture as their vassals.\nNearby are the heathenous regions of Tempe Terra, home to Seaborne Warlords, Olympus Mons, realm of the Hellenic Kingdoms, and Tharsis Montes, where Solarian savages will tie you up and leave you to be judged by the sun. Beyond Tharsis Montes are nomads squabiling among themselves, though who could potentially become an unstopable threat if ever united.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_111905;Elupuyan of Promethei Terra;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_111905;A ship from a nearby star system has arrived to investigate in the wake of the disaster. Because light travel is impossible it took this interstellar ship nearly 1000 years to reach its destination in the Solar System.\nDue to the loss of most of their fleet during the voyage, the crew, known as Spacers, are less prepared than would be viable to complete their mission.  They must trade their advanced tech and knowledge, seen as magic by the majority of Martians, for food and resources in order to survive. They have set up base in the Planum Australe Region near the South Pole, and Promethei Terra on the Shores of the diverse Hellas Sea, settling their people into former nomad territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_103715;Tara of The Survivors;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_103715;Moments before the Spacers first arrived to take Tara's people away from the desolate remains of Earth, her father,  King of the Survivors, had been murdered in cold blood by his brother in-law, Kane. \nYears later, once the Spacers had begun settling the shores of Promethei Terra, the Earthers were given a small island of their own in the Hellas Sea. Much to her horror, leadership was given to her treaturous uncle in-law instead to Tara, the rightful ruler of the Survivors. \nIt was an easy choice when a mysterious man, dubiously claiming to be her distant relative, asked her to accompany him to western Tharsis Rise, a land where Earth is venerated, and claim her place among them as a true Earther and therefor the rightful ruler of the Holy Terran faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_102225;Ragnarr of the Seaborne;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_102225;When the once vast lands of Tempe Terra sank into Oceanus Borealis, leaving only the peninsula seen today, the Seaborne rose from the waters. This tragedy eventually developed into an advantage to the Seaborne, as they mastered the oceans and rivers to take what was needed.\n\nTheir raiders are feared all the way from Mt. Olympus to Valles Marineris, and beyond to the Argyre Sea. They are the boogeymen to all Singularity based religions, including the so-called "Holy" Terra and the "Blessed" Singularity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_108175;While the majority of Holy Terra adherents within West Argyre had long been happy at the prospect of parting ways with the misguided Blessed Singularity Valles Marineris Empire, takeover by blasphemous Terraformed overlords was the last way any self-respecting Singularitan wanted it to \noccur.\n\nThey began plotting in secret to take back Western Argyre for Holy Terra, a feat that had long remained a pipe-dream since the missionaries first spread the true faith to Argyre shortly before  the rise of the Valles Marineris Empire and the schism between Holy Terra and the Blessed Singularity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_218625;CEO Jak of the Remnant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_218625;The Remnant, a small island republic of diverse religions in the middle of the Argyre Sea, praises itself as the last beacon of democracy and the old ways of governance, but faces uncertainty while the long stable Valles Marineris Empire crumbles and loses control of West Argyre to Noachis Terra.\nNow with both sides of the Argyre Sea controlled by the newly united Noachian-Terraformed Empire, will the Remnant be able to maintain their liberty?\nDemocratically elected leaders of the Remnant follow the old, just ways of serving for life, or until removal by faction majority demand, once votes have been counted. While the most respected candidate should generally win in theory, campaign donations, lobbying, and mercenary limits are unrestricted meaning the five corporate families are the only viable candidates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
