#BM_WP_INFO;Cyber Kings - Western Pacific.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_WP_INFO;Cyber Kings - Western Pacific can currently only be used with the Random World setting which requires the Holy Fury DLC, or with the provided save file. Trying to launch the mod without using the Random World setting or save file will crash the game.\n\nLong ago, Earth went dark on the same day all existing electronics in the solar system stopped working. All ships not in orbit fell from the sky.\nHumanity quickly descended into chaos as society collapsed, bringing on a new Dark Age. Most of the population succumbed to famine as governments broke down and nations fractured.\nAround 1000 years later the Western Pacific is recovering and has entered a new Medieval Era, largely forgetting the accurate history of humanity and the disaster. Knowledge of the off-world colonies has faded into myths and legends, until one day a derelict ship, carrying a strange elongated race that cannot survive in the gravity well of Earth, arrived in orbit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_MP_ERA;Random World;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_WP_ERA_INFO;This can currently only be used with the Random World setting which requires the Holy Fury DLC, or with the provided save file. Trying to launch the mod without using the Random World setting or save file will crash the game.\nReligion, culture, and de jure locations have been manually set, so it is ironically recommended to use all historical settings possible within Random World. Random world is a work-around until events can be made compatible.\n\nRecommended settings for Random World:\nAll settings set to Historical, except culture names set to random\nDefault title names\nAll boxes checked except 'More Pagans';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
