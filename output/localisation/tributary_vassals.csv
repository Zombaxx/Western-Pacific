EVTDESC_Trib_02;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nTimes have been hard lately. Unfortunately we can no longer guarantee the prosperity and faithful execution of laws in your lands under our name. With that said, we can offer you the governance of these lands which rightfully belong to you, independent of our meddling. We will of course protect you and yours in case of great need. In return, you will provide us with levies and taxes for protection. \n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_Trib_4041A;Of course, I accept!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Trib_02;W...What do you mean, on my own?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Trib_3206;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA],\n I beseech you to let me remain as a loyal subject of [Root.GetFullBaseName]. I am afraid I wouldn't be able to help [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA] out in case a need suddenly arises. \n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Trib_3206;I will change my mind for a favor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Trib_3206;I have no need of a favor from [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Trib_3207;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nThinking about it, you are of course correct. I was hasty in my decision. Your services as the ruler of the [Root.GetFullName] will be yet required in this realm.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Trib_3208;To the [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nBah, favors! I offer you independence and control of your own realm, and you offer me trinkets. I have no need of your favors!\n\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Trib_3205;To the [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nPerhaps I was hasty. Of course my liege. We accept your offer, and hold you to the offer of protection. \n\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Trib_998;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nTimes are hard. We would be better served with you protecting us, and we swearing fealty to you as our protector.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_Trib_4041A;Accept;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_Trib_4003B;Perhaps...Not Right Now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_Trib_4041C;It is a ship with a great deal of sail but a very shallow keel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Trib_4042;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nLet us celebrate the occasion with wine and sweet words. I love the name of honor, more than I fear death.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Trib_4044;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nWe don't think it's in our best interest to protect you for now, however we offer a non-agression pact for a small compensation. \n Endure the present, and watch for better things. \n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_Trib_4004A;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_Trib_4004B;It is difficult not to read this as satire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Trib_4045;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nWe accept your non-aggression offer, you should receive our thanks shortly.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Trib_4046;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nA fraudulent intent, however carefully concealed at the outset, will generally, in the end, betray itself. \nWe reject your offer.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Trib_1327;Too bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Trib_4021;To [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nTime has come for you to end your autonomous rule and submit under our supreme authority. \n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_Trib_4003A;I doubt it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Trib_4005;To [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nWith what manner of speech did you address me, rake? Be informed that I was peerless among squires during my education. I have aided his majesty the king in numerous campaigns against the Saracens and I have laid low thrice fivescore opponents. I have mastered the delicate art of the night-raid and am the superlative archer in the realm. You, meanwhile, are wholly without worth. Let it be known that I will bring such artifice to your ignominious end as none have yet witnessed within the Lord’s creation. You believe you can volley such insults by way of anonymous missive? My hunters and their keen hounds have already discerned your location, so it is best you hasten preparations for the ensuing tumult, wretch, the species of tumult that will spill your life essences into the gaping maw of Hades. Perhaps if wisdom guided you to see the repercussions of your knavish harangue, you would remained silent. You were unable to do so, however, and now punishment will be exacted on you. I will excrete biliously upon you and in such bilious excretion shall you be overcome. Your time on this earth shall soon cease, peasant.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_Trib_4005A;That little...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Trib_4006;To [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nWe agree to your proposal and look forward to receiving the payment for it.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_Trib_4006A;I knew they would cave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Trib_4004;To [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI believe it would be mutually beneficial if we came to a different sort of an arrangement. We offer to pay a tribute in exchange for us keeping our autonomy.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_Trib_4004A;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_Trib_4004B;Nice try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_Trib_4000C;Do you...like bribes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_Trib_4000C_desc;Offer to pay them some money instead. They can reject and in that case you'll be at war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
