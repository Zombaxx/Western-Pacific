EVTDESCroy_rifles_events.1;A band of exiled Tau Cetinese men have arrived at your capital, answering your call to arms. They marched through [Root.Capital.GetName] singing, with death throwers, that they call 'Rifles', slung across their backs. Their leader, a man with blue hair and an odd ornament blinking light on his face, presented his price to you along with their contract of service. They expect heavy trade concessions and money to secure their loyalty. They have paraded themselves in formation in your courtyard at [Root.Capital.GetName] awaiting orders.;;;x
