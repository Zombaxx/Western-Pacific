BM_WP_INFO;Cyber Kings - Western Pacific.\nLong ago, Earth went dark on the same day all existing electronics in the solar system stopped working. All ships not in orbit fell from the sky. Humanity quickly descended into chaos as society collapsed, bringing on a new Dark Age. Most of the population succumbed to famine as governments broke down and nations fractured.\n\nAround 1000 years later the Western Pacific is recovering and has entered a new Medieval Era, largely forgetting the accurate history of humanity and the disaster.  Knowledge of the off-world colonies has faded into myths and legends, until one day a derelict ship, carrying a strange elongated race that cannot survive in the gravity well of Earth, arrived in orbit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_114975;Duke of Aus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_114975;1066 Years After the Disaster (A.D.) the Western Pacific remains divided. The prominent rival republics of Sydney and Melbourne in south-eastern Australia vie for control over the most populous region on the continent, both possesing wildly differing ideologies, while the Khan of Canterberry claims to be the rightful emperor of both. Meanwhile, the nearby Cult of Scavengers, Solarian, and Animist pagans continue consolidating through the buffer land between the edges of Eastern Australian civilization and the Outback, threatening the eastern realms who have been too caught up in their own politics to take notice. The Pacific Ocean is plagued by Polynesian Pirates that make deep sea travel precarious for all but the most fortified of fleets. All threats to Aus are not external however, as the Novocastrian duke plots a coup to overthrow the republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_107985;Filipino Crusaders;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_107985;Within the Malay Archipelago, from the Catholic islands of the Philippines in the east to the Sunni islands of Indonesia to the west, a new age of Crusades and Jihads is beginning, leaving the fate of East Malaysia in the balance of the coming battles as tensions rise. Holy warriors from both sides prepare for war as a reinvigorated era of conflicts begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_226265;Melbourne Patrician;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_226265;In the ideologically diverse Republic of Melbourne, internal political intrigue can just as dangerous as the agents of Aus and the blood thirsty Scavengers Cult. To the only Masonic patrician of the five families, it wasn't a matter of if he would become doge, it was a matter of when. Although no part of the greater Melbourne area itself is majority Masonic, the countryside to the east largely follows the Ancient ways, and in the Patrician's eyes the only way to stop the onslaught of Aus is to unite these Masonic lands with Melbourne and the rest of Victoria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_110965;Animists of Alice Springs;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_110965;In the times before the Great Disaster, ancient texts say that millions of feral camels were found in over 40% of mainland Australia. Although not originally native to the area, Camels were first introduced into Australia from the Canary Islands in 1840. Once a set of the population escaped captivity and began prospering in the wild it quickly began to double every decade. This combined with climate change made it possible for the existence of the nomadic hordes we see roaming much of the Outback of Australia today. The camels are to these scavenging nomads as the horses were to the steppe nomads of ancient times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_111585;Scavengers of Adelaide;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_111585;The Scavengers Cult take what they need, often sacrificing any extra supplies or prisoners to their gods in the hopes of gaining a much greater bounty. They believe it is best to not carry too much during journeys in between these greater bounties, and to gorge oneself at every opportunity along the way as long as whatever stands in their way is weaker than themselves and not a fellow scavenger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Hope has been restored to Adelaide as the Kingdom of the Eyre sees itself united under the Scavenger's Cult in the wake of the oppressive Immortan's defeat. The legendary war hero Max the Mad has returned from his wandering after having mysteriously disappeared for years into the wasteland immediately after the deciding battle of the war, where he has been rewarded by the King of the Eyre for his great efforts. Although a decorated war hero knwon for his reluctance to rule, some wonder he if has returned a changed man with new amibitions after so many years away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_110165;Solarians of the Outback;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_110165;Deep within the desolate Outback lies a belief that the Sun will bring glory to those who revere him as their god, and that the pious and wicked alike who seek reflection must be judged by the rays of their god.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_116205;The Pirates of Hawaii;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_116205;The mighty Polynesians are known by many regional names due to the inhabiting a territory far more vast than any known to man, both now and at other periods throughout history. To the south they are known as the Maori, to the east the Maoli, and many other names on the numerous islands between. Their unmatched naval navigation skills enable them to maintain a cohesive culture despite vast distances.\n The Hawaiian islands remain fractured, both politically and ideologically, making it a haven for Pirates across the seven seas, though the Catholics and Protestants hope to change this and restore order to the islands. Will the Pirates persevere in retaining these islands as their permanent home, or will they be ousted back to the seven seas from which they came?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_105145;When the Cyborgs and their Spacer subservience first descended from the Himalayan space elevator, which China, the last remaining power of old world governance left on earth, owned, China was surprised to learn these beings were from a very literal Celestial Empire, seemingly ruled by the literal Jade Emperor of legends that China's own Emperors had always spoke of being descended from. China, despite being the most powerful nation from Earth a millennia after the the Great Disaster, soon found itself taken under the wing of their long lost family, gaining unimagined technological wonders, knowledge, and security at the cost of agreeing to pay tribute and to help the Celestial in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
