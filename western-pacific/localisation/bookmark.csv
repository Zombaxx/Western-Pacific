BM_WP_INFO;Cyber Kings - Western Pacific.\nLong ago, Earth went dark on the same day all existing electronics in the solar system stopped working. All ships not in orbit fell from the sky. Humanity quickly descended into chaos as society collapsed, bringing on a new Dark Age. Most of the population succumbed to famine as governments broke down and nations fractured.
Around 1000 years later the Western Pacific is recovering and has entered a new Medieval Era, largely forgetting the accurate history of humanity and the disaster.  Knowledge of the off-world colonies has faded into myths and legends, until one day a derelict ship, carrying a strange elongated race that cannot survive in the gravity well of Earth, arrived in orbit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#BM_WP_INFO;Cyber Kings - Western Pacific can currently only be used with the Random World setting which requires the Holy Fury DLC, or with the provided save file. Trying to launch the mod without using the Random World setting or save file will crash the game.\n\nLong ago, Earth went dark on the same day all existing electronics in the solar system stopped working.

#BM_WP_ERA_INFO;1066 Years After the Disaster (A.D.) the Western Pacific remains divided. Two prominent Republics of differing ideologies in eastern Australia vie for control over the most populous region on the continent, while a man with strange beliefs in Canterberry claims to be the rightful emperor of both. Meanwhile, the nearby Cult of Scavengers, Solarian, and Animist pagans encroach their way through the buffer land between the edges of Eastern Australian civilization and the Outback, threatening the eastern realms who have been too caught up in their own politics to take action.
 The Pacific Ocean is plagued by Polynesian Pirates that make all sea travel extremely dangerous for all but the most fortified of fleets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Meanwhile, the nearby Cult of Scavengers, Solarian, and Animist pagans inch their way through the buffer land between the edges of Eastern Australian civilization and the Outback, threatening the eastern realms who have been too caught up in their own politics to take action.\nTo the north, within the Malay Archipelago, a new age of Crusades and Jihads is beginning. The Pacific Ocean itself is plagued by Polynesian Pirates that make sea travel precarious for all but the most fortified of fleets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
